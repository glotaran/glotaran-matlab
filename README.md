# glotaran-matlab
Matlab plugin for pyglotaran

**Note : 
The application *gta_plotter.mlapp* is partly functional and the development is in progress.** 

*( https://github.com/AvratanuBiswas/glotaran-matlab/tree/master/app/)*

Therefore, **all features within the application are not implemented at this point.**
- The application file <gta_plotter.mlapp> with very basic features is tested and can be used with Matlab version 2018      onnwards
- The standalone compilation not shared here, yet.

**For using the application :**
- Prerequisite - Installation of pyglotaran. Detail description here: https://github.com/glotaran/pyglotaran 
- As mentioned earlier, the compilation of the application not done yet, few steps needs to be taken care of :
  - The repository folder along with the subfolders must be added to the matlab path
  - Running the application file i.e <gta_plotter.mlapp> using Matlab (**_make sure that the matlab runs from it's installation   folder       i.e.    ..../MATLAB_R2019b.app/bin/./matlab_**)    
  - Once the application opens, check the version of the installed pyglotaran from the 'Help' menu bar
  - If the version pops up successfully, the application is working and can be used further. 
  - Please make sure to report any sorts of error.
  
  
  **Application features :**
  
  _At this point, very basic features are implemented. Such as quick analysis with the analysis schema and access to the outputs._
